<h2> interest </h2>
    <p> I was always interested in drawing, and i used to copy other people's art, or art from games, cartoons, and anime. It was something i've always done for fun, but at a certain point i wanted to start improving, which is what marks the start of my journey. </p>

<h2> where and how am i supposed to start? </h2>
    <p> When i was younger, i didn't want to take an art class, so it was pretty difficult to decide what course of action i should take. When highschool applications came along, i applied to LaGuardia. I didn't actually want to attend the school, but just wanted to see and expand my options. Suprisingly, even though i had to audition, they accepted. This didn't really mean much to me, other than the fact that i knew i wasn't absolutely terrible at drawing. I decided to teach myself through the internet and by books from artists, leaving art as a hobby. </p>

<h2> what i'm doing now </h2> 
    <p> Currently, as stated before, i'm trying to learn myself by buying books from well-known artists and watching/following videos online. I usually don't look up tutorials; i prefer to find those who work in the industry and are well-known in their industry. Even though i'm not working towards a job in the art industry, i feel like it is a lot better to learn and follow those who know what they are saying and have credentials, rather than a popular video that some random artist posted online. </p>
